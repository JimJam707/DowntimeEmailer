# DowntimeEmailer
Checks for an internet connection and then sends an email via GMail alerting to down times.

## Usage
To use, set up a "config.cfg" file in the same directory as main.py in the same format as "sample config.cfg".

"Allow less secure apps" needs to be enabled here: [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security?pli=1#connectedapps) and possibly here: [Google - Less Secure Apps](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps). Sadly this will not work on accounts that use two factor authentication yet.
